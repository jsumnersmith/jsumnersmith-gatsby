excerpt: "A translation of my favorite Neruda sonnet"
---

_by Pablo Neruda._ [_Original Text_](https://www.poeticous.com/neruda/soneto-lxxvii)

_Traducido de mi, Joel Smith, 2020._


Today is today with the weight of all time past,<br/>
with the wings of all that will be tomorrow,<br/>
it is the ends of the sea, the antiquity of the water<br/>
composing itself into a new day.<br/>

To your mouth, upturned to the sun and the moon,<br/>
the petals of a day consumed accumulate,<br/>
and yestereday comes plodding down its shaded alley<br/>
as if we should remember the face of one who died.<br/>

Today, yesterday, and tomorrow are consumed in passing,<br/>
we consume days like voracious cattle,<br/>
our livestock hopes in spite of numbered days.<br/>

But in your heart time has sown its wheat,<br/>
my love built its oven with the mud of Temuco:<br/>
you are the the daily bread for my soul.
